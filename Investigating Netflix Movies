###What was the most frequent movie duration in the 1990s? Save an approximate answer as an integer called duration (use 1990 as the decade's start year).
#make sure the data is filtered to "Movie" and in the 1990s
filtered=netflix_df[netflix_df['type']=='Movie']
print(filtered)
duration=filtered['release_year']
print(duration)
import numpy as np
between=np.logical_and(duration>=1990,duration<2000)
filtered=filtered[between]
print(filtered.head(4))
duration=filtered
#plot the graph
plt.hist(duration['duration'])
plt.title('The Average Duration in the 1990s')
plt.xlabel('Duration')
plt.ylabel('Number of Movies')
plt.show()
#answer
duration=100

###A movie is considered short if it is less than 90 minutes. Count the number of short action movies released in the 1990s and save this integer as short_movie_count.
filtered=filtered[filtered['genre']=='Action']
print(filtered)
#set the counter to 0
short_movie_count=0
#make a loop to count how many movies that are less than 90 minutes
for index,row in filtered.iterrows():
    if row['duration']<90:
        short_movie_count=short_movie_count+1
    else:
        short_movie_count=short_movie_count
print(short_movie_count)
#answer
short_movie_count=7
