The following is a list of Python projects I have created on my own time in order to improve my skills.

1. Rock, Paper, Scissors - This is a simple game that involves choosing between three options between you and a computer.

2. Fill in the Blanks - You complete the blanks in a narrative you will read at the end.

3. Guessing the Number - Attempt to guess a correct number from 1-10 in ten tries will determine whether you win or not.

4. Netflix Data Analysis - I analyze my Netflix data and provide answers to three key questions regarding the duration of TV shows I have watched.
